Hence, `1 minute and 0 seconds` is not valid, but it should be just `1 minute`.\n\n A unit of time must be used \"as much as possible\".

If the number of the characters in name is less than or equal to two, it will return an array containing only the name as is\"\n","totalAttempts":38883,"totalCompleted":14622,"totalStars":150,"voteScore":1742,"tags":["Fundamentals","Strings"],"contributorsWanted":true,"unresolved":{"issues":0,"suggestions":1},"language":"javascript","solution":"function whoIsPaying(name){\n  if (name.length > 2) {\n    return [name, name.slice(0, 2)]\n} return [name];\n}","completedAt":"2023-02-22T11:56:14.906Z","completedLanguages":["javascript"]},{"id":"58d248c7012397a81800005c","name":"Find out whether the shape is a cube","slug":"find-out-whether-the-shape-is-a-cube","category":"reference","publishedAt":"2017-03-22T10:01:54.076Z","approvedAt":"2017-11-21T05:31:23.041Z","languages":["javascript","csharp","python","ruby","php","typescript","c","factor","cpp","scala","coffeescript","java","lua"],"url":"https://www.codewars.com/kata/58d248c7012397a81800005c","rank":{"id":-8,"name":"8 kyu","color":"white"},"createdAt":"2017-03-22T09:50:00.374Z","createdBy":{"username":"Thomas_J","url":"https://www.codewars.com/users/Thomas_J"},"approvedBy":{"username":"ZED.CWT","url":"https://www.codewars.com/users/ZED.CWT"},"description":"To find the volume (centimeters cubed) of a cuboid you use the formula:\n\n```volume = Length * Width * Height```\n    \nBut someone forgot to use proper record keeping, so we only have the volume, and the length of a single side!\n\nIt's up to you to find out whether the cuboid has equal sides (= is a cube).\n\nReturn `true` if the cuboid could have equal sides, return `false` otherwise.\n\nReturn `false` for invalid numbers too (e.g volume or side is less than or equal to 0).\n\nNote: side will be an integer\n","totalAttempts":78647,"totalCompleted":27188,"totalStars":209,"voteScore":2366,"tags":["Fundamentals"],"contributorsWanted":true,"unresolved":{"issues":1,"suggestions":0},"language":"javascript","solution":"var cubeChecker = function(volume, side){\n  if(volume <= 0 || side <= 0){\n  return false;\n  }\n  return volume == side*side*side;\n};","completedAt":"2023-02-22T11:49:01.292Z","completedLanguages":["javascript"]},{"id":"57cff961eca260b71900008f","name":"Is there a vowel in there?","slug":"is-there-a-vowel-in-there","category":"reference","publishedAt":"2016-09-07T11:30:04.033Z","approvedAt":"2016-09-09T13:16:58.259Z","languages":["javascript","coffeescript","csharp","python","ruby","php","haskell","racket","crystal","julia","r","groovy"],"url":"https://www.codewars.com/kata/57cff961eca260b71900008f","rank":{"id":-8,"name":"8 kyu","color":"white"},"createdAt":"2016-09-07T11:26:26.039Z","createdBy":{"username":"PG1","url":"https://www.codewars.com/users/PG1"},"approvedBy":{"username":"myjinxin2015","url":"https://www.codewars.com/users/myjinxin2015"},"description":"Given an array of numbers, check if any of the numbers are the character codes for lower case vowels (`a, e, i, o, u`).\n\nIf they are, change the array value to a string of that vowel.\n\nReturn the resulting array.","totalAttempts":40617,"totalCompleted":14807,"totalStars":264,"voteScore":1662,"tags":["Fundamentals","Strings","Arrays"],"contributorsWanted":true,"unresolved":{"issues":2,"suggestions":0},"language":"javascript","solution":"function isVow(a){\n  return a.map(v=> \"aeiou\".includes(String.fromCharCode(v))?String.fromCharCode(v):v)\n}","completedAt":"2023-02-22T11:23:46.386Z","completedLanguages":["javascript"]},{"id":"559f80b87fa8512e3e0000f5","name":"Are arrow functions odd?","slug":"are-arrow-functions-odd","category":"reference","publishedAt":"2015-07-10T08:22:16.397Z","approvedAt":"2015-07-13T01:12:05.457Z","languages":["javascript","haskell","elixir","csharp","ruby","python"],"url":"https://www.codewars.com/kata/559f80b87fa8512e3e0000f5","rank":{"id":-8,"name":"8 kyu","color":"white"},"createdAt":"2015-07-10T08:22:23.392Z","createdBy":{"username":"acraileanu","url":"https://www.codewars.com/users/acraileanu"},"approvedBy":{"username":"MMMAAANNN","url":"https://www.codewars.com/users/MMMAAANNN"},"description":"Time to test your basic knowledge in functions!

But, of course, only Santa himself is allowed to use this wonderful transportation. And in order to make sure, that only he can board the sleigh, there's an authentication mechanism.\n\nYour task is to implement the `authenticate()` method of the sleigh, which takes the name of the person, who wants to board the sleigh and a secret password. If, and only if, the name equals \"Santa Claus\" and the password is \"Ho Ho Ho!\" *(yes, even Santa has a secret password with uppercase and lowercase letters and special characters :D)*, the return value must be `true`.

Use ```===, ==, >, <, >=, <=``` between two variables(or constant), the result of such an expression is a bool value. The operation between the two bool values can be used with logical operators:```&&, ||, !``` or some bitwise operators:```&, |, ^```\n\nMany of the data are likely to be implicitly converted to Boolean values in a given context, most common in conditional statements. In other words, the Boolean value is mainly used for conditional judgment. Look this example:\n```\nvar arr=[];\n...\n...\n......\nif (arr.length) return \"arr has elements\";\nelse            return \"arr is empty\";\n```\n\nYou can see, arr is defined as an array, arr.length should be a number value, but in this example, the number value should convert to bool value. it means, if arr.length value is 0, convert value to ```false```, if arr.length value is not 0, convert value to ```true```.\n\nThese values are converted to ```false``` in the conditional statement:\n```\n0, -0, \"\", null, undefined, NaN\n```\n\n## Task\n\nCoding in function ```trueOrFalse```, function accept 1  parameters:```val```, try to use the conditional statement if...else, if ```val``` value is false (val==false or it can convert to false), should return a string \"false\", if not, return a string \"true\".\n\nWhen you have finished the work, click \"Run Tests\" to see if your code is working properly.\n\nIn the end, click \"Submit\" to submit your code pass this kata.\n    \n## [Series](http://github.com/myjinxin2015/Katas-list-of-Training-JS-series)\n\n( ↑↑↑ Click the link above can get my newest kata list, Please add it to your favorites)\n\n -

The first part, `var sum=0,num=1`, is the initialization. This part will run before the loop starts. The second part, `num<=100` is the conditional expression. The conditional expression is checked before the start of each time through the loop. When the value of the expression is false, the loop will be terminated. The third part, `num++` will run after the code block, and is usually used for increasing and decreasing variables.\n\nFor the example above, the running order of the code is:\n```javascript\n                              <--- back to part 2\n                  -------------------------------------------\n                  |                 true                    |\nvar sum=0,num=1  --->  num<=100 ?  ------> code block---> num++\n                                |  \n                           false|\n                       loop terminated\n```\n\nWhen you need to traverse an array, you can use the `for` loop to access each element using its index. Here's an example:\n```javascript\nfunction displayElements(array){\n  for (var i=0;i<array.length;i++){\n    console.log(array[i]);\n  }\n}\n```\nThis function will display every element of the array on your screen.\n\nOk, lesson is over, let's do a task with ```for```.\n\n## Task\n\nThe function ```pickIt``` accepts 1 parameter, ```arr```, which is an array of numbers. We need to traverse ```arr``` by using a ```for``` loop. If an element is an odd number, push it to the ```odd``` array, and if it's an even number, push it to the ```even```array.\n    \nI've defined two arrays ```odd``` and ```even``` in the function, and also wrote the return statement. **Your work is to write a `for` loop.**\n    \nIf you forgot how to push an element to an array, please refer to [lesson 4](http://www.codewars.com/kata/571effabb625ed9b0600107a).\n    \n## [Series](http://github.com/myjinxin2015/Katas-list-of-Training-JS-series)\n\n( ↑↑↑ Click the link above can get my newest kata list, Please add it to your favorites)\n\n -

Following the \"`:`\" you can add your code for what to do in that case. The keyword ```break``` is used as termination - if you forget `break`, the code will continue running through the other `case` statements and `default` until a `break` appears. If no `case` statements match, `default` is entered.\n\nIn some instances, the ```switch``` statement is clearer than the ```if..else``` statement.\n\nFor example, we can write a function to calculate what day today is, like this:\n```javascript\nfunction whatDayIsToday(n){\n  // getDay() is a method of Date() - we will learn this later\n  var day=new Date().getDay(),x; \n  switch (day){\n    case 0:\n      x=\"Today it's Sunday\";\n      break;\n    case 1:\n      x=\"Today it's Monday\";\n      break;\n    case 2:\n      x=\"Today it's Tuesday\";\n      break;\n    case 3:\n      x=\"Today it's Wednesday\";\n      break;\n    case 4:\n      x=\"Today it's Thursday\";\n      break;\n    case 5:\n      x=\"Today it's Friday\";\n      break;\n    case 6:\n      x=\"Today it's Saturday\";\n      break;\n  }\n  return x;\n}\n```\n\n## Task\n\nComplete the function ```howManydays```. It accepts 1 parameter ```month```, which means the month of the year. Different months have a different number of days as shown in the table below. Return the number of days that are in `month`.
